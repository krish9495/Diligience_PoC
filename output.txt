🧩 Why Cognee Outperforms Baseline RAG

Unlike a traditional RAG pipeline that retrieves only from unstructured text, Cognee unifies information across documents, databases, and knowledge graphs.
In this example, while RAG failed to link Alpha Fund’s SOC 2 report with its internal management data, Cognee successfully correlated both sources — recognizing that no remediation was required and identifying Raj Singh as the Data Privacy Analyst.
This demonstrates Cognee’s ability to deliver contextually complete, cross-domain answers, essential for enterprise diligence, audit, and compliance workflows.
